Here's what fixed this error for me (using VirtualBox 4.3):

Go to File → Virtual Media Manager
In the Hard drives tab, you should see a red exclamation point icon beside the disk image you're having trouble with. Select it → Release → Remove → Close.
Go back into the settings for the VM and readd the disk.
To prevent the error in the future, before deleting the virtual disk image files, remove them from the Virtual Media Manager:

Go to File → Virtual Media Manager
In the Hard drives tab, find the virtual disk you want to remove, select it → Release → Remove → Keep (or Delete if you want to delete it permanently) → Close.
Go back into the settings for the VM and readd the disk.
